Please find the detailed Project requirements attached below. Request you to please create a PDF documents with all the details of each step along with screenshots for submission.

1. **Source Code Repository (GitHub):**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
   - Push your Node.js project files to the repository.

2. **Jenkins Setup:**
   - Install Jenkins on a server or virtual machine.
   - Follow the official Jenkins installation guide for your operating system.
   - Access Jenkins through your web browser and complete the initial setup.

3. **Automatic Build:**
   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline project.
   - Configure the pipeline to connect to your GitHub repository.
   - Write a Jenkinsfile in your repository to define the build steps.
   - The Jenkinsfile should include commands to install dependencies (`npm install`) and run tests (`npm test`).
   - Trigger the build automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

4. **Automatic Testing:**
   - Integrate testing scripts into your Jenkins pipeline.
   - Use a testing framework like Jest for writing automated tests for your Node.js application.
   - Add a testing stage to your Jenkinsfile to execute the automated tests after the build stage.

5. **Containerization:**
   - Write a Dockerfile in your project directory to define the Docker image for your application.
   - Configure Jenkins to build the Docker image as part of the pipeline.
   - Use Docker build commands in your Jenkinsfile to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.

6. **Deployment to Minikube:**
   - Install Minikube on a server or virtual machine where Jenkins is running.
   - Write Ansible playbooks to provision the Minikube cluster and deploy your Docker containers as Kubernetes pods.
   - Configure Jenkins to execute the Ansible playbooks as part of the pipeline.
   - Add a deployment stage to your Jenkinsfile to trigger the Ansible playbooks after the Docker image is built.

7. **Automatic Deployment Testing:**
   - Write automated tests to verify the deployment of your application to Minikube.
   - Use tools like Selenium for UI testing or Jest for API testing.
   - Integrate the deployment tests into your Jenkins pipeline.
   - Add a testing stage to your Jenkinsfile to execute the deployment tests after the deployment stage.

8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up monitoring and logging for your Minikube cluster and application.
   - Use tools like Prometheus for monitoring and Elasticsearch-Fluentd-Kibana (EFK) stack for logging.
   - Configure alerts and notifications to detect and respond to issues in your deployment.

9. **Security:**
   - Implement security best practices for your CI/CD pipeline and application.
   - Use tools like SonarQube for code analysis and vulnerability scanning.
   - Ensure that secrets and sensitive information are securely managed and stored.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Document the CI/CD pipeline setup, including configuration, scripts, and dependencies.
    - Provide instructions for developers on how to contribute to the project and use the CI/CD pipeline.

By following these implementation steps, you can set up a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, testing, containerization, deployment, and monitoring of your Node.js application on Minikube.
